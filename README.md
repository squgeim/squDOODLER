squDOODLER
==========

A simple program in python to doodle. It uses the Curses library. I did it just to kill some hours, so don't expect it to be anything much.

System Requirements
---
- Should work on Linux and Mac OS X, as they probably already have Python in them.
- I'm not sure if Python in Windows has the curses library. If it does, great, it should work then. But you'll have to install python.

To Run
---
- Get the program in you computer. Download the zip file from the right column, or simply copy the code and paste in in your text editor and save it with a '.py' extention.
- Open the terminal and browse to the directory with the file.
- Run
<code>python squDOODLE.py</code>

Controls
---

- Use the cursor control keys to move the cusor around.
- Use s and d keys to put the pen in on or off state
- Use a to erase anything under the cursor (it's best to keep the pen off while doing this)
- Use c to reset the screen
- Press any other key to exit
